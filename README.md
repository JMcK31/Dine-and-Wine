This is my Code Louisville React class project.

To view this project:
Node Package Manager must be installed in your text editor.
- Clone the Repository
- npm Install the project
- npm install Bootstrap
- run: npm start

The application uses the Spoonacular API to search for three different endpoints:
 - Pair Food with wine entered in the search bar
 - Pair a Wine with a food item or cuisine entered in the search bar
 - Search for a varietal Recommendation. Enter a wine varietal in the search


Kudos to Amy Talbot for her help with the Typography and Header!
